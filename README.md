# About
this repository is my own adblock filter lists that i find useful. current filter lists is as follows:

## [ads.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsapoorsh/adblock-filter-list/main/filters/ads.txt)
any advertisement that refers to other domains.

## [annoyances.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parsapoorsh/adblock-filter-list/main/filters/annoyances.txt)
unnecessary self-advertisement that without it the functionality of the site will not be lost

## for uBlock origin
add these URLs to custom filters â†“
